# N8N Paid chat

This allows you to put your whole N8N workflow behind a paywall on a friendly chat interface. You can then use any N8N native tool, or connect to any MCP server, so the possibilities are endless.

In N8N, create a new workflow and then use the import from file option ([download the raw workflow](./n8n-paid-chat.json))
